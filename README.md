description of task 4:Database Backup and Recovery is the process of creating copies of data to protect against data loss and ensuring data can be restored in case of failure. Backup involves periodically saving copies of the database to secure storage, while recovery restores data from these backups after accidental deletion, corruption, or system failures. Effective backup strategies include full, incremental, and differential backups, ensuring minimal downtime and data integrity. Recovery methods, such as point-in-time recovery and transaction log restoration, help maintain business continuity and prevent data loss.
